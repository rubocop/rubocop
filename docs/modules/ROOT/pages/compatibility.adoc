= Compatibility

RuboCop targets Ruby 2.5+.footnote:[As defined by its reference implementation MRI.]

RuboCop officially supports MRI (a.k.a. CRuby) and JRuby.

- MRI 2.5+
- JRuby 9.2+

The oldest supported JRuby version is derived from the oldest compatible MRI version.

NOTE: RuboCop might be working with other Ruby implementations as well, but it's tested only on MRI and JRuby.

== Support Matrix

RuboCop generally aims to follow MRI's own support policy - meaning RuboCop would support all officially supported MRI releases.footnote:[Typically the last 3 releases.] To give people extra time for a smooth transition, we've customarily provided support for about one year after EOL of MRI version.
This means that if Ruby 2.5 reaches its EOL in Spring 2021, it would be supported by RuboCop (at least) until Spring 2022.footnote:[At the core team's discretion this policy might be waived aside for MRI releases causing significant maintenance overhead.]

The following table is the support matrix.

|===
| Supported target Ruby version | Last supported RuboCop version

| 1.9 | 0.41
| 2.0 | 0.50
| 2.1 | 0.57
| 2.2 | 0.68
| 2.3 | 0.81
| 2.4 | 1.12
| 2.5 | -
| 2.6 | -
| 2.7 | -
| 3.0 | -
| 3.1 | -

NOTE: The compatibility xref:configuration.adoc#setting-the-target-ruby-version[target Ruby version mentioned here] is about code analysis (what RuboCop can analyze), not runtime (is RuboCop capable of running on some Ruby or not).

== Forward Compatibility

Features may be provided for development version of Ruby. These are all considered experimental, and may change before the stable version of Ruby will be released.
