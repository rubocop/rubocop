|===

Looks for expressions containing multiple binary operators
where precedence is ambiguous due to lack of parentheses. For example,
in `1 + 2 * 3`, the multiplication will happen before the addition, but
lexically it appears that the addition will happen first.

The cop does not consider unary operators (ie. `!a` or `-b`) or comparison
operators (ie. `a =~ b`) because those are not ambiguous.

NOTE: Ranges are handled by `Lint/AmbiguousRange`.

[#examples-lintambiguousoperatorprecedence]

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
a + b * c
a || b && c
a ** b + c

|===

Checks for ambiguous ranges.

Ranges have quite low precedence, which leads to unexpected behavior when
using a range with other operators. This cop avoids that by making ranges
explicit by requiring parenthesis around complex range boundaries (anything
that is not a literal: numerics, strings, symbols, etc.).

This cop can be configured with `RequireParenthesesForMethodChains` in order to
specify whether method chains (including `self.foo`) should be wrapped in parens
by this cop.

NOTE: Regardless of this configuration, if a method receiver is a basic literal
value, it will be wrapped in order to prevent the ambiguity of `1..2.to_a`.

[#safety-lintambiguousrange]
=== Safety

The cop autocorrects by wrapping the entire boundary in parentheses, which
makes the outcome more explicit but is possible to not be the intention of the
programmer. For this reason, this cop's autocorrect is unsafe (it will not
change the behavior of the code, but will not necessarily match the
intent of the program).

| 1.71

|===

Checks for an array literal interpolated inside a regexp.

When interpolating an array literal, it is converted to a string. This means
that when inside a regexp, it acts as a character class but with additional
quotes, spaces and commas that are likely not intended. For example,
`/#{%w[a b c]}/` parses as `/["a", "b", "c"]/` (or `/["a, bc]/` without
repeated characters).

The cop can autocorrect to a character class (if all items in the array are a
single character) or alternation (if the array contains longer items).

NOTE: This only considers interpolated arrays that contain only strings, symbols,
integers, and floats. Any other type is not easily convertible to a character class
or regexp alternation.

[#safety-lintarrayliteralinregexp]
=== Safety

Autocorrection is unsafe because it will change the regexp pattern, by
removing the additional quotes, spaces and commas from the character class.

[#examples-lintarrayliteralinregexp]

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

Checks for places where binary operator has identical operands.

It covers comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `=~`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, ``<=``;
bitwise operators: `|`, `^`, `&`;
boolean operators: `&&`, `||`
and "spaceship" operator - ``<=>``.

Simple arithmetic operations are allowed by this cop: `+`, `*`, `**`, `<<` and `>>`.
Although these can be rewritten in a different way, it should not be necessary to
do so. Operations such as `-` or `/` where the result will always be the same
(`x - x` will always be 0; `x / x` will always be 1) are offenses, but these
are covered by `Lint/NumericOperationWithConstantResult` instead.

[#safety-lintbinaryoperatorwithidenticaloperands]

This cop is unsafe as it does not consider side effects when calling methods

Do not define constants within a block, since the block's scope does not
isolate or namespace the constant in any way.

If you are trying to define that constant once, define it outside of
the block instead, or use a variable or method if defining the constant
in the outer scope would be problematic.

For meta-programming, use `const_set`.

Checks for constant reassignments.

Emulates Ruby's runtime warning "already initialized constant X"
when a constant is reassigned in the same file and namespace using the
`NAME = value` syntax.

The cop cannot catch all offenses, like, for example, when a constant
is reassigned in another file, or when using metaprogramming (`Module#const_set`).

The cop only takes into account constants assigned in a "simple" way: directly
inside class/module definition, or within another constant. Other type of assignments
(e.g., inside a conditional) are disregarded.

The cop also tracks constant removal using `Module#remove_const` with symbol
or string argument.

[#examples-lintconstantreassignment]

# bad

Check that certain constants are fully qualified.

This is not enabled by default because it would mark a lot of offenses
unnecessarily.

Generally, gems should fully qualify all constants to avoid conflicts with
the code that uses the gem. Enable this cop without using `Only`/`Ignore`

Large projects will over time end up with one or two constant names that
are problematic because of a conflict with a library or just internally
using the same name a namespace and a class. To avoid too many unnecessary
offenses, Enable this cop with `Only: [The, Constant, Names, Causing, Issues]`

NOTE: `Style/RedundantConstantBase` cop is disabled if this cop is enabled to prevent
conflicting rules. Because it respects user configurations that want to enable
this cop which is disabled by default.

| Enabled

| 0.62
| 0.88
|===

Checks constructors for disjunctive assignments (`||=`) that should
be plain assignments.

So far, this cop is only concerned with disjunctive assignment of
instance variables.

In ruby, an instance variable is nil until a value is assigned, so the
disjunction is unnecessary. A plain assignment has the same effect.

[#safety-lintdisjunctiveassignmentinconstructor]
=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because it can register a false positive when a
method is redefined in a subclass that calls super. For example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Base
  def initialize
    @config ||= 'base'
  end
end

class Derived < Base
  def initialize
    @config = 'derived'
    super
  end
end
----

Without the disjunctive assignment, `Derived` will be unable to override
the value for `@config`.

[#examples-lintdisjunctiveassignmentinconstructor]

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
def initialize
  @x ||= 1
end

# good
def initialize

Checks that there are no repeated bodies
within `if/unless`, `case-when`, `case-in` and `rescue` constructs.

With `IgnoreLiteralBranches: true`, branches are not registered
as offenses if they return a basic literal value (string, symbol,
integer, float, rational, complex, `true`, `false`, or `nil`), or
return an array, hash, regexp or range that only contains one of
the above basic literal values.

With `IgnoreConstantBranches: true`, branches are not registered
as offenses if they return a constant value.

With `IgnoreDuplicateElseBranch: true`, in conditionals with multiple branches,
duplicate 'else' branches are not registered as offenses.

Checks for odd `else` block layout - like

Its autocorrection tweaks layout to keep the syntax. So, this autocorrection
is compatible correction for bad case syntax, but if your code makes a mistake
with `elsif` and `else`, you will have to correct it manually.

# This code is compatible with the bad case. It will be autocorrected like this.
if something
  # ...
else
  do_this
  do_that

# This code is incompatible with the bad case.
# If `do_this` is a condition, `elsif` should be used instead of `else`.
if something

Checks for the presence of precise comparison of floating point numbers.

Floating point values are inherently inaccurate, and comparing them for exact equality
is almost never the desired semantics. Comparison via the `==/!=` operators checks
floating-point value representation to be exactly the same, which is very unlikely
if you perform any arithmetic operations involving precision loss.

Prefer using `Hash#compare_by_identity` rather than using `object_id`
for hash keys.

This cop looks for hashes being keyed by objects' `object_id`, using
one of these methods: `key?`, `has_key?`, `fetch`, `[]` and `[]=`.

[#safety-linthashcomparebyidentity]

This cop is unsafe. Although unlikely, the hash could store both object
ids and other values that need be compared by value, and thus
could be a false positive.

Furthermore, this cop cannot guarantee that the receiver of one of the
methods (`key?`, etc.) is actually a hash.

In Ruby 3.4, keyword arguments will instead be used to change the behavior of a hash.
For example, the capacity option can be passed to create a hash with a certain size
if you know it in advance, for better performance.

Checks for `IO.select` that is incompatible with Fiber Scheduler since Ruby 3.0.

When an array of IO objects waiting for an exception (the third argument of `IO.select`)
is used as an argument, there is no alternative API, so offenses are not registered.

NOTE: When the method is successful the return value of `IO.select` is `[[IO]]`,
and the return value of `io.wait_readable` and `io.wait_writable` are `self`.
They are not autocorrected when assigning a return value because these types are different.
It's up to user how to handle the return value.

Checks for the presence of constructors and lifecycle callbacks
without calls to `super`.

This cop does not consider `method_missing` (and `respond_to_missing?`)
because in some cases it makes sense to overtake what is considered a
missing method. In other cases, the theoretical ideal handling could be
challenging or verbose for no actual gain.

Autocorrection is not supported because the position of `super` cannot be
determined automatically.

`Object` and `BasicObject` are allowed by this cop because of their
stateless nature. However, sometimes you might want to allow other parent
classes from this cop, for example in the case of an abstract class that is
not meant to be called with `super`. In those cases, you can use the
`AllowedParentClasses` option to specify which classes should be allowed
*in addition to* `Object` and `BasicObject`.

`Dir[...]` and `Dir.glob(...)` do not make any guarantees about
the order in which files are returned. The final order is
determined by the operating system and file system.
This means that using them in cases where the order matters,
such as requiring files, can lead to intermittent failures
that are hard to debug. To ensure this doesn't happen,
always sort the list.

`Dir.glob` and `Dir[]` sort globbed results by default in Ruby 3.0.
So all bad cases are acceptable when Ruby 3.0 or higher are used.

| 0.53
| 1.1
|===

Warns the usage of unsafe number conversions. Unsafe
number conversion can cause unexpected error if auto type conversion
fails. Cop prefer parsing with number class instead.

Conversion with `Integer`, `Float`, etc. will raise an `ArgumentError`
if given input that is not numeric (eg. an empty string), whereas
`to_i`, etc. will try to convert regardless of input (``''.to_i => 0``).
As such, this cop is disabled by default because it's not necessarily
always correct to raise if a value is not numeric.

NOTE: Some values cannot be converted properly using one of the `Kernel`
method (for instance, `Time` and `DateTime` values are allowed by this
cop by default). Similarly, Rails' duration methods do not work well
with `Integer()` and can be allowed with `AllowedMethods`. By default,
there are no methods to allowed.

[#safety-lintnumberconversion]

Autocorrection is unsafe because it is not guaranteed that the

Certain numeric operations have a constant result, usually 0 or 1.
Multiplying a number by 0 will always return 0.
Dividing a number by itself or raising it to the power of 0 will always return 1.

These are probably leftover from debugging, or are mistakes.
Other numeric operations that are similarly leftover from debugging or mistakes
are handled by `Lint/UselessNumericOperation`.

NOTE: This cop doesn't detect offenses for the `-` and `%` operator because it

Checks for unnecessary `require` statement.

The following features are unnecessary `require` statement because
they are already loaded. e.g. Ruby 2.2:

| Always (Unsafe)
| 0.93
| 1.79
|===

Checks for redundant safe navigation calls.
Use cases where a constant, named in camel case for classes and modules is `nil` are rare,
and an offense is not detected when the receiver is a constant. The detection also applies
to `self`, and to literal receivers, except for `nil`.

For all receivers, the `instance_of?`, `kind_of?`, `is_a?`, `eql?`, `respond_to?`,
and `equal?` methods are checked by default.
These are customizable with `AllowedMethods` option.

The `AllowedMethods` option specifies nil-safe methods,
in other words, it is a method that is allowed to skip safe navigation.
Note that the `AllowedMethod` option is not an option that specifies methods
for which to suppress (allow) this cop's check.

In the example below, the safe navigation operator (`&.`) is unnecessary
because `NilClass` has methods like `respond_to?` and `is_a?`.

The `InferNonNilReceiver` option specifies whether to look into previous code
paths to infer if the receiver can't be nil. This check is unsafe because the receiver
can be redefined between the safe navigation call and previous regular method call.
It does the inference only in the current scope, e.g. within the same method definition etc.

The `AdditionalNilMethods` option specifies additional custom methods which are
defined on `NilClass`. When `InferNonNilReceiver` is set, they are used to determine
whether the receiver can be nil.

[#safety-lintredundantsafenavigation]
=== Safety

This cop is unsafe, because autocorrection can change the return type of
the expression. An offending expression that previously could return `nil`
will be autocorrected to never return `nil`.

== Lint/RedundantTypeConversion

|===

| 1.72

|===

Checks for redundant uses of `to_s`, `to_sym`, `to_i`, `to_f`, `to_d`, `to_r`, `to_c`,
`to_a`, `to_h`, and `to_set`.

When one of these methods is called on an object of the same type, that object
is returned, making the call unnecessary. The cop detects conversion methods called
on object literals, class constructors, class `[]` methods, and the `Kernel` methods
`String()`, `Integer()`, `Float()`, BigDecimal(), `Rational()`, `Complex()`, and `Array()`.

Specifically, these cases are detected for each conversion method:

* `to_s` when called on a string literal, interpolated string, heredoc,
  or with `String.new` or `String()`.
* `to_sym` when called on a symbol literal or interpolated symbol.
* `to_i` when called on an integer literal or with `Integer()`.
* `to_f` when called on a float literal of with `Float()`.
* `to_r` when called on a rational literal or with `Rational()`.
* `to_c` when called on a complex literal of with `Complex()`.
* `to_a` when called on an array literal, or with `Array.new`, `Array()` or `Array[]`.
* `to_h` when called on a hash literal, or with `Hash.new`, `Hash()` or `Hash[]`.
* `to_set` when called on `Set.new` or `Set[]`.

In all cases, chaining one same `to_*` conversion methods listed above is redundant.

The cop can also register an offense for chaining conversion methods on methods that are
expected to return a specific type regardless of receiver (eg. `foo.inspect.to_s` and
`foo.to_json.to_s`).

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because `include M` will affect the included class
if any changes are made to module `M`.

Checks for a rescued exception that get shadowed by a
less specific exception being rescued before a more specific
exception is rescued.

An exception is considered shadowed if it is rescued after its
ancestor is, or if it and its ancestor are both rescued in the
same `rescue` statement. In both cases, the more specific rescue is
unnecessary because it is covered by rescuing the less specific
exception. (ie. `rescue Exception, StandardError` has the same behavior
whether `StandardError` is included or not, because all ``StandardError``s
are rescued by `rescue Exception`).

|===

Checks for the use of local variable names from an outer scope
in block arguments or block-local variables. This mirrors the warning
given by `ruby -cw` prior to Ruby 2.6:
"shadowing outer local variable - foo".

The cop is now disabled by default to match the upstream Ruby behavior.
It's useful, however, if you'd like to avoid shadowing variables from outer
scopes, which some people consider an anti-pattern that makes it harder
to keep track of what's going on in a program.

NOTE: Shadowing of variables in block passed to `Ractor.new` is allowed
because `Ractor` should not access outer variables.
eg. following style is encouraged:

[source,ruby]
----
worker_id, pipe = env
Ractor.new(worker_id, pipe) do |worker_id, pipe|
end
----

Checks for `Hash` creation with a mutable default value.
Creating a `Hash` in such a way will share the default value
across all keys, causing unexpected behavior when modifying it.

For example, when the `Hash` was created with an `Array` as the argument,
calling `hash[:foo] << 'bar'` will also change the value of all
other keys that have not been explicitly assigned to.

[#examples-lintsharedmutabledefault]
=== Examples

[source,ruby]

# bad
Hash.new([])
Hash.new({})
Hash.new(Array.new)

# okay -- In rare cases that intentionally have this behavior,
#   without disabling the cop, you can set the default explicitly.
h = Hash.new
h.default = []
h[:a] << 1
h[:b] << 2
h # => {:a => [1, 2], :b => [1, 2]}

# okay -- beware this will discard mutations and only remember assignments
Hash.new { Array.new }
Hash.new { Hash.new }
Hash.new { {} }
Hash.new { [] }

# good - frozen solution will raise an error when mutation attempted
Hash.new([].freeze)
Hash.new({}.freeze)

# good - using a proc will create a new object for each key

# good - using a block will create a new object for each key

The cop is unsafe for autocorrection because unexpected errors occurring in the argument
passed to numeric constructor (e.g., `Integer()`) can lead to incompatible behavior.
For example, changing it to `Integer(potential_exception_method_call, exception: false)`
ensures that exceptions raised by `potential_exception_method_call` are not ignored.

Checks for "triple quotes" (strings delimited by any odd number
of quotes greater than 1).

Ruby allows multiple strings to be implicitly concatenated by just
being adjacent in a statement (ie. `"foo""bar" == "foobar"`). This sometimes
gives the impression that there is something special about triple quotes, but
in fact it is just extra unnecessary quotes and produces the same string. Each
pair of quotes produces an additional concatenated empty string, so the result
is still only the "actual" string within the delimiters.

NOTE: Although this cop is called triple quotes, the same behavior is present
for strings delimited by 5, 7, etc. quotation marks.

Checks for a block that is known to need more positional
block arguments than are given (by default this is configured for

Looks for `reduce` or `inject` blocks where the value returned (implicitly or
explicitly) does not include the accumulator. A block is considered valid as
long as at least one return value includes the accumulator.

If the accumulator is not included in the return value, then the entire
block will just return a transformation of the last element value, and
could be rewritten as such without a loop.

Also catches instances where an index of the accumulator is returned, as
this may change the type of object being retained.

NOTE: For the purpose of reducing false positives, this cop only flags
returns in `reduce` blocks where the element is the only variable in
the expression (since we will not be able to tell what other variables
relate to via static analysis).

Checks for redundant access modifiers, including those with no
code, those which are repeated, those which are on top-level, and
leading `public` modifiers in a class or module body.
Conditionally-defined methods are considered as always being defined,
and thus access modifiers guarding such methods are not redundant.

This cop has `ContextCreatingMethods` option. The default setting value
is an empty array that means no method is specified.
This setting is an array of methods which, when called, are known to
create its own context in the module's current access context.

It also has `MethodCreatingMethods` option. The default setting value
is an empty array that means no method is specified.

|===

Checks for every useless assignment to local variable in every
scope.
The basic idea for this cop was from the warning of `ruby -cw`:

[source,console]
----
assigned but unused variable - foo
----

Currently this cop has advanced logic that detects unreferenced
reassignments and properly handles varied cases such as branch, loop,
rescue, ensure, etc.

This cop's autocorrection avoids cases like `a ||= 1` because removing assignment from
operator assignment can cause `NameError` if this assignment has been used to declare
a local variable. For example, replacing `a ||= 1` with `a || 1` may cause
"undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object (NameError)".

NOTE: Given the assignment `foo = 1, bar = 2`, removing unused variables
can lead to a syntax error, so this case is not autocorrected.

Checks for usage of method `fetch` or `Array.new` with default value argument
and block. In such cases, block will always be used as default value.

This cop emulates Ruby warning "block supersedes default value argument" which
applies to `Array.new`, `Array#fetch`, `Hash#fetch`, `ENV.fetch` and
`Thread#fetch`.

A `fetch` call without a receiver is considered a custom method and does not register
an offense.

[#safety-lintuselessdefaultvalueargument]
=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because the receiver could have nonstandard implementation
of `fetch`, or be a class other than the one listed above.

It is also unsafe because default value argument could have side effects:

[source,ruby]
----
def x(a) = puts "side effect"
Array.new(5, x(1)) { 2 }
----

so removing it would change behavior.

[#examples-lintuselessdefaultvalueargument]
=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
x.fetch(key, default_value) { block_value }
Array.new(size, default_value) { block_value }

# good
x.fetch(key) { block_value }
Array.new(size) { block_value }

# also good - in case default value argument is desired instead
x.fetch(key, default_value)
Array.new(size, default_value)

# good - keyword arguments aren't registered as offenses

Checks for calls to `defined?` with strings or symbols as the argument.
Such calls will always return `'expression'`, you probably meant to
check for the existence of a constant, method, or variable instead.

`defined?` is part of the Ruby syntax and doesn't behave like normal methods.
You can safely pass in what you are checking for directly, without encountering
a `NameError`.

When interpolation is used, oftentimes it is not possible to write the
code with `defined?`. In these cases, switch to one of the more specific methods:

* `class_variable_defined?`
* `const_defined?`
* `method_defined?`
* `instance_variable_defined?`
* `binding.local_variable_defined?`

[#examples-lintuselessdefined]

Checks for useless OR (`||` and `or`) expressions.

Some methods always return a truthy value, even when called
on `nil` (e.g. `nil.to_i` evaluates to `0`). Therefore, OR expressions
appended after these methods will never evaluate.

[#safety-lintuselessor]

As shown in the examples below, there are generally two possible ways to correct the
offense, but this cop’s autocorrection always chooses the option that preserves the
current behavior. While this does not change how the code behaves, that option is not
necessarily the appropriate fix in every situation. For this reason, the autocorrection
provided by this cop is considered unsafe.

Checks for operators, variables, literals, lambda, proc and nonmutating
methods used in void context.

`each` blocks are allowed to prevent false positives.
For example, the expression inside the `each` block below.
It's not void, especially when the receiver is an `Enumerator`:

[source,ruby]

enumerator = [1, 2, 3].filter
enumerator.each { |item| item >= 2 } #=> [2, 3]

NOTE: Return values in assignment method definitions such as `def foo=(arg)` are
detected because they are in a void context. However, autocorrection does not remove
the return value, as that would change behavior. In such cases, whether to remove
the return value or rename the method to something more appropriate should be left to
the user.
