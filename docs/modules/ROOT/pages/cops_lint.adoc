|===

This cop looks for expressions containing multiple binary operators
where precedence is ambiguous due to lack of parentheses. For example,
in `1 + 2 * 3`, the multiplication will happen before the addition, but
lexically it appears that the addition will happen first.

The cop does not consider unary operators (ie. `!a` or `-b`) or comparison
operators (ie. `a =~ b`) because those are not ambiguous.

NOTE: Ranges are handled by `Lint/AmbiguousRange`.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
a + b * c
a || b && c
a ** b + c

# good (different precedence)
a + (b * c)
a || (b && c)
(a ** b) + c

# good (same precedence)
a + b + c
a * b / c % d

| 1.19
| -
|===

This cop checks for ambiguous ranges.

Ranges have quite low precedence, which leads to unexpected behaviour when
using a range with other operators. This cop avoids that by making ranges
explicit by requiring parenthesis around complex range boundaries (anything
that is not a literal: numerics, strings, symbols, etc.).

This cop can be configured with `RequireParenthesesForMethodChains` in order to
specify whether method chains (including `self.foo`) should be wrapped in parens
by this cop.

NOTE: Regardless of this configuration, if a method receiver is a basic literal
value, it will be wrapped in order to prevent the ambiguity of `1..2.to_a`.

=== Safety

The cop autocorrects by wrapping the entire boundary in parentheses, which
makes the outcome more explicit but is possible to not be the intention of the
programmer. For this reason, this cop's autocorrect is unsafe (it will not
change the behaviour of the code, but will not necessarily match the
intent of the program).

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
x || 1..2
(x || 1..2)
1..2.to_a

# good, unambiguous
1..2
'a'..'z'
:bar..:baz
MyClass::MIN..MyClass::MAX
@min..@max
a..b
-a..b

# good, ambiguity removed
x || (1..2)
(x || 1)..2
(x || 1)..(y || 2)
(1..2).to_a

|===

This cop checks for places where binary operator has identical operands.

It covers arithmetic operators: `-`, `/`, `%`;
comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `=~`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`;
bitwise operators: `|`, `^`, `&`;
boolean operators: `&&`, `||`
and "spaceship" operator - `<=>`.

Simple arithmetic operations are allowed by this cop: `+`, `*`, `**`, `<<` and `>>`.
Although these can be rewritten in a different way, it should not be necessary to
do so. This does not include operations such as `-` or `/` where the result will
always be the same (`x - x` will always be 0; `x / x` will always be 1), and
thus are legitimate offenses.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe as it does not consider side effects when calling methods
and thus can generate false positives, for example:

[source,ruby]
----
if wr.take_char == '\0' && wr.take_char == '\0'
  # ...

=== Examples

[source,ruby]

Do not define constants within a block, since the block's scope does not
isolate or namespace the constant in any way.

If you are trying to define that constant once, define it outside of
the block instead, or use a variable or method if defining the constant
in the outer scope would be problematic.

For meta-programming, use `const_set`.

Check that certain constants are fully qualified.

This is not enabled by default because it would mark a lot of offenses
unnecessarily.

Generally, gems should fully qualify all constants to avoid conflicts with
the code that uses the gem. Enable this cop without using `Only`/`Ignore`

Large projects will over time end up with one or two constant names that
are problematic because of a conflict with a library or just internally
using the same name a namespace and a class. To avoid too many unnecessary
offenses, Enable this cop with `Only: [The, Constant, Names, Causing, Issues]`

| 0.62
| 0.88
|===

This cop checks constructors for disjunctive assignments (`||=`) that should
be plain assignments.

So far, this cop is only concerned with disjunctive assignment of
instance variables.

In ruby, an instance variable is nil until a value is assigned, so the
disjunction is unnecessary. A plain assignment has the same effect.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because it can register a false positive when a
method is redefined in a subclass that calls super. For example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Base
  def initialize
    @config ||= 'base'
  end
end

class Derived < Base
  def initialize
    @config = 'derived'
    super

Without the disjunctive assignment, `Derived` will be unable to override
the value for `@config`.

is compatible correction for bad case syntax, but if your code makes a mistake
with `elsif` and `else`, you will have to correct it manually.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

if something
  # ...
else do_this
  do_that
end
----

[source,ruby]
----
# good

# This code is compatible with the bad case. It will be autocorrected like this.
if something
  # ...
else
  do_this
  do_that
end

# This code is incompatible with the bad case.
# If `do_this` is a condition, `elsif` should be used instead of `else`.
if something
  # ...

`ERB.new` with non-keyword arguments is deprecated since ERB 2.2.0.
Use `:trim_mode` and `:eoutvar` keyword arguments to `ERB.new`.
This cop identifies places where `ERB.new(str, trim_mode, eoutvar)` can

|===

This cop checks for the presence of precise comparison of floating point numbers.

Floating point values are inherently inaccurate, and comparing them for exact equality
is almost never the desired semantics. Comparison via the `==/!=` operators checks
floating-point value representation to be exactly the same, which is very unlikely
if you perform any arithmetic operations involving precision loss.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
x == 0.1
x != 0.1

# good - using BigDecimal
x.to_d == 0.1.to_d

# good
(x - 0.1).abs < Float::EPSILON

# good
tolerance = 0.0001
(x - 0.1).abs < tolerance

# Or some other epsilon based type of comparison:

expected fields for format/sprintf/#% and what is actually
passed as arguments.

In addition it checks whether different formats are used in the same
format string. Do not mix numbered, unnumbered, and named formats in
the same format string.

=== Examples

Prefer using `Hash#compare_by_identity` rather than using `object_id`
for hash keys.

This cop looks for hashes being keyed by objects' `object_id`, using
one of these methods: `key?`, `has_key?`, `fetch`, `[]` and `[]=`.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe. Although unlikely, the hash could store both object
ids and other values that need be compared by value, and thus
could be a false positive.

Furthermore, this cop cannot guarantee that the receiver of one of the
methods (`key?`, etc.) is actually a hash.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
hash = {}
hash[foo.object_id] = :bar
hash.key?(baz.object_id)

# good
hash = {}.compare_by_identity
hash[foo] = :bar
hash.key?(baz)

|===

This cop checks for `IO.select` that is incompatible with Fiber Scheduler since Ruby 3.0.

NOTE: When the method is successful the return value of `IO.select` is `[[IO]]`,
and the return value of `io.wait_readable` and `io.wait_writable` are `self`.
They are not autocorrected when assigning a return value because these types are different.
It's up to user how to handle the return value.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because `NoMethodError` occurs
if `require 'io/wait'` is not called.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
IO.select([io], [], [], timeout)

# good

This cop checks for the presence of constructors and lifecycle callbacks
without calls to `super`.

This cop does not consider `method_missing` (and `respond_to_missing?`)
because in some cases it makes sense to overtake what is considered a
missing method. In other cases, the theoretical ideal handling could be
challenging or verbose for no actual gain.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]

# bad
class Employee < Person
  def initialize(name, salary)
    @salary = salary
  end

# good
class Employee < Person
  def initialize(name, salary)

== Lint/NonDeterministicRequireOrder

|===
| Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | Version Added | Version Changed

| Enabled

| Yes (Unsafe)
| 0.78
| -
|===

`Dir[...]` and `Dir.glob(...)` do not make any guarantees about
the order in which files are returned. The final order is
determined by the operating system and file system.
This means that using them in cases where the order matters,
such as requiring files, can lead to intermittent failures
that are hard to debug. To ensure this doesn't happen,
always sort the list.

`Dir.glob` and `Dir[]` sort globbed results by default in Ruby 3.0.
So all bad cases are acceptable when Ruby 3.0 or higher are used.

NOTE: This cop will be deprecated and removed when supporting only Ruby 3.0 and higher.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe in the case where sorting files changes existing
expected behaviour.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
Dir["./lib/**/*.rb"].each do |file|
  require file
end

# good
Dir["./lib/**/*.rb"].sort.each do |file|
  require file
end

# bad

This cop checks for non-local exits from iterators without a return
value. It registers an offense under these conditions:

* No value is returned,
* the block is preceded by a method chain,
* the block has arguments,
* the method which receives the block is not `define_method`
or `define_singleton_method`,
* the return is not contained in an inner scope, e.g. a lambda or a
method definition.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]

== Lint/NumberConversion

|===
| Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | Version Added | Version Changed

| Disabled
| Yes
| Yes (Unsafe)
| 0.53
| 1.1
|===

This cop warns the usage of unsafe number conversions. Unsafe
number conversion can cause unexpected error if auto type conversion
fails. Cop prefer parsing with number class instead.

Conversion with `Integer`, `Float`, etc. will raise an `ArgumentError`
if given input that is not numeric (eg. an empty string), whereas
`to_i`, etc. will try to convert regardless of input (`''.to_i => 0`).
As such, this cop is disabled by default because it's not necessarily
always correct to raise if a value is not numeric.

NOTE: Some values cannot be converted properly using one of the `Kernel`
method (for instance, `Time` and `DateTime` values are allowed by this
cop by default). Similarly, Rails' duration methods do not work well
with `Integer()` and can be ignored with `IgnoredMethods`.

=== Safety

Autocorrection is unsafe because it is not guaranteed that the
replacement `Kernel` methods are able to properly handle the
input if it is not a standard class.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

'10'.to_i
'10.2'.to_f
'10'.to_c
'1/3'.to_r
['1', '2', '3'].map(&:to_i)

This cop checks for uses of numbered parameter assignment.
It emulates the following warning in Ruby 2.7:

  % ruby -ve '_1 = :value'
  ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [x86_64-darwin19]
  -e:1: warning: `_1' is reserved for numbered parameter; consider another name

Assigning to a numbered parameter (from `_1` to `_9`) causes an error in Ruby 3.0.

  % ruby -ve '_1 = :value'
  ruby 3.0.0p0 (2020-12-25 revision 95aff21468) [x86_64-darwin19]
  -e:1: _1 is reserved for numbered parameter

NOTE: The parametered parameters are from `_1` to `_9`. This cop checks `_0`, and over `_10`
as well to prevent confusion.

=== Examples

| No
| Yes (Unsafe)
| 1.9

|===

This cop checks for unintended or-assignment to a constant.

Constants should always be assigned in the same location. And its value
should always be the same. If constants are assigned in multiple
locations, the result may vary depending on the order of `require`.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because code that is already conditionally
assigning a constant may have its behaviour changed by
autocorrection.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
CONST ||= 1

# good
CONST = 1

| No
| No
| 0.89
| -
|===

This cops looks for references of Regexp captures that are out of range
and thus always returns nil.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because it is naive in how it determines what
references are available based on the last encountered regexp, but
it cannot handle some cases, such as conditional regexp matches, which
leads to false positives, such as:

[source,ruby]
----
foo ? /(c)(b)/ =~ str : /(b)/ =~ str
do_something if $2
# $2 is defined for the first condition but not the second, however
# the cop will mark this as an offense.
----

This might be a good indication of code that should be refactored,
however.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
/(foo)bar/ =~ 'foobar'

# bad - always returns nil

puts $2 # => nil

# good

It is more likely that the additional characters are unintended (for
example, mistranslating an array of literals to percent string notation)
rather than meant to be part of the resulting strings.

=== Safety

The cop is unsafe because the correction changes the values in the array
and that might have been done purposely.

[source,ruby]
----
%w('foo', "bar") #=> ["'foo',", '"bar"']
%w(foo bar)      #=> ['foo', 'bar']

This cop checks for `raise` or `fail` statements which are
raising `Exception` class.

You can specify a module name that will be an implicit namespace
using `AllowedImplicitNamespaces` option. The cop cause a false positive
for namespaced `Exception` when a namespace is omitted. This option can
prevent the false positive by specifying a namespace to be omitted for
`Exception`. Alternatively, make `Exception` a fully qualified class
name with an explicit namespace.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because it will change the exception class being
raised, which is a change in behaviour.

|===

This cop detects instances of rubocop:disable comments that can be
removed without causing any offenses to be reported. It's implemented
as a cop in that it inherits from the Cop base class and calls
add_offense. The unusual part of its implementation is that it doesn't
have any on_* methods or an investigate method. This means that it
doesn't take part in the investigation phase when the other cops do
their work. Instead, it waits until it's called in a later stage of the
execution. The reason it can't be implemented as a normal cop is that
it depends on the results of all other cops to do its work.

| -
|===

This cop checks for redundant safe navigation calls.
`instance_of?`, `kind_of?`, `is_a?`, `eql?`, `respond_to?`, and `equal?` methods
are checked by default. These are customizable with `AllowedMethods` option.

In the example below, the safe navigation operator (`&.`) is unnecessary
because `NilClass` has methods like `respond_to?` and `is_a?`.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe, because autocorrection can change the return type of
the expression. An offending expression that previously could return `nil`
will be autocorrected to never return `nil`.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

|===
| Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | Version Added | Version Changed

| Pending
| Yes
| No
| 1.27
| -
|===

This cop checks if `include` or `prepend` is called in `refine` block.
These methods are deprecated and should be replaced with `Refinement#import_methods`.

It emulates deprecation warnings in Ruby 3.1.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because `include M` will affect the included class
if any changes are made to module `M`.
On the other hand, `import_methods M` uses a snapshot of method definitions,
thus it will not be affected if module `M` changes.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refine Foo do
  include Bar
end

# bad
refine Foo do
  prepend Bar
end

# good
refine Foo do
  import_methods Bar

This cop checks for expressions where there is a call to a predicate
method with at least one argument, where no parentheses are used around
the parameter list, and a boolean operator, && or ||, is used in the
last argument.

The idea behind warning for these constructs is that the user might
be under the impression that the return value from the method call is
an operand of &&/||.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

While the safe navigation operator is generally a good idea, when
checking `foo&.empty?` in a conditional, `foo` being `nil` will actually
do the opposite of what the author intends.

"shadowing outer local variable - foo".

NOTE: Shadowing of variables in block passed to `Ractor.new` is allowed
because `Ractor` should not access outer variables.
eg. following style is encouraged:

  worker_id, pipe = env

|===

This cop checks for "triple quotes" (strings delimited by any odd number
of quotes greater than 1).

Ruby allows multiple strings to be implicitly concatenated by just
being adjacent in a statement (ie. `"foo""bar" == "foobar"`). This sometimes
gives the impression that there is something special about triple quotes, but
in fact it is just extra unnecessary quotes and produces the same string. Each
pair of quotes produces an additional concatenated empty string, so the result
is still only the "actual" string within the delimiters.

NOTE: Although this cop is called triple quotes, the same behavior is present
for strings delimited by 5, 7, etc. quotation marks.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
"""
  A string
"""

# bad

This cop checks for a block that is known to need more positional
block arguments than are given (by default this is configured for
`Enumerable` methods needing 2 arguments). Optional arguments are allowed,
although they don't generally make sense as the default value will
be used. Blocks that have no receiver, or take splatted arguments
(ie. `*args`) are always accepted.

Keyword arguments (including `**kwargs`) do not get counted towards
this, as they are not used by the methods in question.

Method names and their expected arity can be configured like this:

|===

Looks for `reduce` or `inject` blocks where the value returned (implicitly or
explicitly) does not include the accumulator. A block is considered valid as
long as at least one return value includes the accumulator.

If the accumulator is not included in the return value, then the entire
block will just return a transformation of the last element value, and
could be rewritten as such without a loop.

Also catches instances where an index of the accumulator is returned, as
this may change the type of object being retained.

NOTE: For the purpose of reducing false positives, this cop only flags
returns in `reduce` blocks where the element is the only variable in
the expression (since we will not be able to tell what other variables
relate to via static analysis).

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
(1..4).reduce(0) do |acc, el|
  el * 2
end

# bad, may raise a NoMethodError after the first iteration
%w(a b c).reduce({}) do |acc, letter|

end

# good
(1..4).reduce(0) do |acc, el|
  acc + el * 2
end

# good, element is returned but modified using the accumulator
values.reduce do |acc, el|
  el << acc
  el
end

# good, returns the accumulator instead of the index
%w(a b c).reduce({}) do |acc, letter|
  acc[letter] = true

end

# good, at least one branch returns the accumulator
values.reduce(nil) do |result, value|
  break result if something?

# good, recursive

statement in non-final position in `begin` (implicit) blocks.

# bad

def some_method
  return
  do_something
end

# bad

def some_method
  if cond
    return
  else

|===

This cop checks for loops that will have at most one iteration.

A loop that can never reach the second iteration is a possible error in the code.
In rare cases where only one iteration (or at most one iteration) is intended behavior,
the code should be refactored to use `if` conditionals.

NOTE: Block methods that are used with `Enumerable`s are considered to be loops.

`IgnoredPatterns` can be used to match against the block receiver in order to allow
code that would otherwise be registered as an offense (eg. `times` used not in an
`Enumerable` context).

== Lint/UselessAccessModifier

| Enabled
| Yes
| Yes
| 0.20
| 0.83
|===

This cop checks for redundant access modifiers, including those with no
code, those which are repeated, and leading `public` modifiers in a
class or module body. Conditionally-defined methods are considered as
always being defined, and thus access modifiers guarding such methods
are not redundant.

This cop has `ContextCreatingMethods` option. The default setting value
is an empty array that means no method is specified.
This setting is an array of methods which, when called, are known to
create its own context in the module's current access context.

It also has `MethodCreatingMethods` option. The default setting value
is an empty array that means no method is specified.
This setting is an array of methods which, when called, are known to
create other methods in the module's current access context.

# bad

  def method

|===

This cop checks for every useless assignment to local variable in every
scope.
The basic idea for this cop was from the warning of `ruby -cw`:

  assigned but unused variable - foo

Currently this cop has advanced logic that detects unreferenced
reassignments and properly handles varied cases such as branch, loop,
rescue, ensure, etc.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

def some_method
  some_var = 1
  do_something
end
----

NOTE: This syntax is no longer valid on Ruby 2.6 or higher and
this cop is going to be removed at some point the future.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----

|===

This cop checks for useless method definitions, specifically: empty constructors
and methods just delegating to `super`.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe as it can register false positives for cases when an empty
constructor just overrides the parent constructor, which is bad anyway.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
def initialize
  super
end

def method
  super
end

# good - with default arguments
def initialize(x = Object.new)
  super
end

# good

  super

== Lint/UselessRuby2Keywords

| Pending

| 1.23

|===

This cop looks for `ruby2_keywords` calls for methods that do not need it.

`ruby2_keywords` should only be called on methods that accept an argument splat
(`*args`) but do not explicit keyword arguments (`k:` or `k: true`) or
a keyword splat (`**kwargs`).

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# good (splat argument without keyword arguments)
ruby2_keywords def foo(*args); end

# bad (no arguments)
ruby2_keywords def foo; end

# good
def foo; end

# bad (positional argument)
ruby2_keywords def foo(arg); end

# good
def foo(arg); end

# bad (double splatted argument)
ruby2_keywords def foo(**args); end

# good
def foo(**args); end

# bad (keyword arguments)
ruby2_keywords def foo(i:, j:); end

# good
def foo(i:, j:); end

# bad (splat argument with keyword arguments)
ruby2_keywords def foo(*args, i:, j:); end

# good
def foo(*args, i:, j:); end

# bad (splat argument with double splat)
ruby2_keywords def foo(*args, **kwargs); end

# good
def foo(*args, **kwargs); end

# bad (ruby2_keywords given a symbol)
def foo; end
ruby2_keywords :foo

== Lint/UselessSetterCall

|===
| Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | Version Added | Version Changed

| Enabled
| No
| Yes (Unsafe)
| 0.13
| 1.2
|===

This cop checks for setter call to local variable as the final
expression of a function definition.

=== Safety

There are edge cases in which the local variable references a
value that is also accessible outside the local scope. This is not
detected by the cop, and it can yield a false positive.

As well, autocorrection is unsafe because the method's
return value will be changed.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

def something
  x = Something.new
  x.attr = 5
end
----

[source,ruby]
----
# good

def something
  x = Something.new
  x.attr = 5
  x

== Lint/UselessTimes

|===

| 0.91
| -
|===

This cop checks for uses of `Integer#times` that will never yield
(when the integer <= 0) or that will only ever yield once
(`1.times`).

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe as `times` returns its receiver, which is
*usually* OK, but might change behavior.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
-5.times { do_something }
0.times { do_something }
1.times { do_something  }
1.times { |i| do_something(i) }
