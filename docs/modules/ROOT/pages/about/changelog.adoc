= Changelog

An extensive changelog is available https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[here].

NOTE: Only user-visible changes are documented there.

== Changelog Generation

The changelog is automatically generated from the files in https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/blob/master/changelog/[the changelog folder]
at release time. Direct editing of the changelog file is discouraged as it often creates merge conflicts (pretty much every PR would modify
this file and this used to be quite the annoyance in the past). One can create new changelog entries like this:

     $ bundle exec rake changelog:new
     $ bundle exec rake changelog:fix
     $ bundle exec rake changelog:change

Those commands correspond to "new feature", "bug-fix" and "changed" entries in the changelog. To update the changelog file you can
run:

     $ bundle exec rake changelog:merge

NOTE: Typically only the RuboCop maintainers would need to do this.

=== Background

Our `CHANGELOG.md` file was previously updated manually by each
contributor that felt their change warranted an entry. When two merge
requests added their own entries at the same spot in the list, it
created a merge conflict in one as soon as the other was merged. When
we had dozens of merge requests fighting for the same changelog entry
location, this quickly became a major source of merge conflicts and
delays in development.

Eventually we adopted GitLab's solution to this common problem, that they discussed https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/changelog.html#history-and-reasoning[here].

== Release Notes

You can also peruse the release notes for individual release over at https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/releases[GitHub].
