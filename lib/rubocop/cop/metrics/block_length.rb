      # Checks if the length of a block exceeds some maximum value.
      # Comment lines can optionally be ignored.

      #
      # You can set literals you want to fold with `CountAsOne`.
      # Available are: 'array', 'hash', and 'heredoc'. Each literal
      # will be counted as one line regardless of its actual size.

      #
      # NOTE: The `ExcludedMethods` configuration is deprecated and only kept
      # for backwards compatibility. Please use `IgnoredMethods` instead.
      # By default, there are no methods to ignored.

      # @example CountAsOne: ['array', 'heredoc']
