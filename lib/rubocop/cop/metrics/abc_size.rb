      # (method calls), and conditions. See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbcMetric
      # and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Software_Metric.
      #
      # Interpreting ABC size:
      #
      # * <= 17 satisfactory

      # * > 30 dangerous

      # You can have repeated "attributes" calls count as a single "branch".
      # For this purpose, attributes are any method with no argument; no attempt
      # is meant to distinguish actual `attr_reader` from other methods.
      #
      # @example CountRepeatedAttributes: false (default is true)
      #
      #    # `model` and `current_user`, refenced 3 times each,
      #    # are each counted as only 1 branch each if
      #    # `CountRepeatedAttributes` is set to 'false'
      #
      #    def search
      #      @posts = model.active.visible_by(current_user)
