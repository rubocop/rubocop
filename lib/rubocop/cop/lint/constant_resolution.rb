      # Check that certain constants are fully qualified.

      # This is not enabled by default because it would mark a lot of offenses
      # unnecessarily.
      #
      # Generally, gems should fully qualify all constants to avoid conflicts with
      # the code that uses the gem. Enable this cop without using `Only`/`Ignore`
      #
      # Large projects will over time end up with one or two constant names that
      # are problematic because of a conflict with a library or just internally
      # using the same name a namespace and a class. To avoid too many unnecessary
      # offenses, Enable this cop with `Only: [The, Constant, Names, Causing, Issues]`
      #
      # NOTE: `Style/RedundantConstantBase` cop is disabled if this cop is enabled to prevent
      # conflicting rules. Because it respects user configurations that want to enable
      # this cop which is disabled by default.
      #
      # @example
      #   # By default checks every constant
      #
      #   # bad
      #   User

      #   # bad
      #   User::Login
