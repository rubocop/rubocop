# N.B.!! This is the config for the legacy readthedocs site.
# All of the docs pages have been removed from the source, and Page Redirects
# have been setup in the RTD admin console. This means that all rubocop.readthedocs.io
# links should be redirected to their corresponding docs page at docs.rubocop.org.
