An epic release - the one which contains the most new features and
bugfixes since the inception of the project!  A huge thanks to the
amazing contributors who helped make it a reality!

Notably, this release adds support for Ruby 2.3 and introduces the
important concept of a target Ruby version - meaning RuboCop will no
longer try to parse the code with a parser matching the interpreter
you're using, but a parser matching the target Ruby version you
specified in `.rubocop.yml`. This way you won't introduce accidentally
syntax from a newer Ruby when you want to maintain
compatibility with certain older Rubies.

Enjoy!

### New features

* [#2598](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/2598): New cop `Lint/RandOne` checks for `rand(1)`, `Kernel.rand(1.0)` and similar calls. Such call are most likely a mistake because they always return `0`. ([@DNNX][])
* [#2590](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/2590): New cop `Performance/DoubleStartEndWith` checks for two `start_with?` (or `end_with?`) calls joined by `||` with the same receiver, like `str.start_with?('x') || str.start_with?('y')` and suggests using one call instead: `str.start_with?('x', 'y')`. ([@DNNX][])
* [#2583](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/2583): New cop `Performance/TimesMap` checks for `x.times.map{}` and suggests replacing them with `Array.new(x){}`. ([@DNNX][])

### Changes

* [#2427](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/2427): Allow non-snake-case file names (e.g. `some-random-script`) for Ruby scripts that have a shebang. ([@sometimesfood][])
* [#2430](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/2430): `Lint/UnneededDisable` now adds "unknown cop" to messages if cop names in `rubocop:disable` comments are unrecognized, or "did you mean ..." if they are misspelled names of existing cops. ([@jonas054][])
* [#947](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/947): `Style/Documentation` considers classes and modules which only define constants to be "namespaces", and doesn't flag them for lack of a documentation comment. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#2467](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2467): Explicitly inheriting configuration from the rubocop gem in .rubocop.yml is not allowed. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#2322](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2322): Output of --auto-gen-config shows content of default config parameters which are Arrays; this is especially useful for SupportedStyles. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#1566](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/1566): When autocorrecting on Windows, line endings are not converted to "\r\n" in untouched portions of the source files; corrected portions may use "\n" rather than "\r\n". ([@alexdowad][])
* New `rake repl` task can be used for experimentation when working on RuboCop. ([@alexdowad][])
* `Lint/SpaceBeforeFirstArg` cop has been removed, since it just duplicates `Style/SingleSpaceBeforeFirstArg`. ([@alexdowad][])
* `Style/SingleSpaceBeforeFirstArg` cop has been renamed to `Style/SpaceBeforeFirstArg`, which more accurately reflects what it now does. ([@alexdowad][])
* `Style/UnneededPercentQ` reports `%q()` strings with what only appears to be an escape, but is not really (there are no escapes in `%q()` strings). ([@alexdowad][])
* `Performance/StringReplacement`, `Performance\StartWith`, and `Performance\EndWith` more accurately identify code which can be improved. ([@alexdowad][])
* The `MultiSpaceAllowedForOperators` config parameter for `Style/SpaceAroundOperators` has been removed, as it is made redundant by `AllowForAlignment`. If someone attempts to use it, config validation will fail with a helpful message. ([@alexdowad][])
* The `RunRailsCops` config parameter in .rubocop.yml is now obsolete. If someone attempts to use it, config validation will fail with a helpful message. ([@alexdowad][])
* If .rubocop.yml contains configuration for a custom cop, no warning regarding "unknown cop" will be printed. The custom cop must inherit from RuboCop::Cop::Cop, and must be loaded into memory for this to work. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#2102](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2102): If .rubocop.yml exists in the working directory when running --auto-gen-config, any `Exclude` config parameters in .rubocop.yml will be merged into the generated .rubocop_todo.yml. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#1895](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/1895): Remove `Rails/DefaultScope` cop. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#2550](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2550): New `TargetRubyVersion` configuration parameter can be used to specify which version of the Ruby interpreter the inspected code is intended to run on. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#2557](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2557): `Style/GuardClause` does not warn about `if` nodes whose condition spans multiple lines. ([@alexdowad][])
* `Style/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody`, `Style/EmptyLinesAroundModuleBody`, and `Style/EmptyLinesAroundBlockBody` accept an empty body with no blank line, even if configured to `empty_lines` style. This is because the empty lines only serve to provide a break between the header, body, and footer, and are redundant if there is no body. ([@alexdowad][])
* [#2554](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2554): `Style/FirstMethodArgumentLineBreak` handles implicit hash arguments without braces; `Style/FirstHashElementLineBreak` still handles those with braces. ([@alexdowad][])
* `Style/TrailingComma` has been split into `Style/TrailingCommaInArguments` and `Style/TrailingCommaInLiteral`. ([@alexdowad][])
* RuboCop returns process exit code 2 if it fails due to bad configuration, bad CLI options, or an internal error. If it runs successfully but finds one or more offenses, it still exits with code 1, as was previously the case. This is helpful when invoking RuboCop programmatically, perhaps from a script.
