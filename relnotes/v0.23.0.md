This release is mostly about fixing bugs, but it also features a few prominent changes:

* Cops are now namespace aware, which would it make it simpler to write RuboCop extensions without
  worrying about name collisions (e.g. you can now have `Style/Filename` and `RSpec/Filename` cops).
* There's now logic which prevents auto-corrections from generated invalid Ruby code.
* The `Rubocop` module was renamed to `RuboCop`, which will affect packages relying
  on RuboCop's public API.

Below is the list of all the gory details. Enjoy!
