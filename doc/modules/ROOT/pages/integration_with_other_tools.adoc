provides RuboCop integration for Visual Studio Code. RuboCop is also used for the formatting
capabilities of this extension.

=== Other Editors

Here's one great opportunity to contribute to RuboCop - implement
RuboCop integration for your favorite editor.

== Git pre-commit hook integration

https://github.com/brigade/overcommit[overcommit] is a fully configurable and
extendable Git commit hook manager. To use RuboCop with overcommit, add the
following to your `.overcommit.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
PreCommit:
  RuboCop:
    enabled: true
----

== Guard integration

If you're fond of https://github.com/guard/guard[Guard] you might
like
https://github.com/yujinakayama/guard-rubocop[guard-rubocop]. It
allows you to automatically check Ruby code style with RuboCop when
files are modified.

== Rake integration

To use RuboCop in your `Rakefile` add the following:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'rubocop/rake_task'

RuboCop::RakeTask.new
----

If you run `rake -T`, the following two RuboCop tasks should show up:

[source,sh]
----
$ rake rubocop                                  # Run RuboCop
$ rake rubocop:auto_correct                     # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
----

The above will use default values

[source,ruby]
----
require 'rubocop/rake_task'

desc 'Run RuboCop on the lib directory'
RuboCop::RakeTask.new(:rubocop) do |task|
  task.patterns = ['lib/**/*.rb']
  # only show the files with failures
  task.formatters = ['files']
  # don't abort rake on failure
  task.fail_on_error = false
end
----
