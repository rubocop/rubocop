This cop checks that the ABC size of methods is not higher than the
configured maximum. The ABC size is based on assignments, branches
(method calls), and conditions. See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbcMetric
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Software_Metric.

This cop checks for excessive nesting of conditional and looping
constructs.

You can configure if blocks are considered using the `CountBlocks`
option. When set to `false` (the default) blocks are not counted
towards the nesting level. Set to `true` to count blocks as well.

The maximum level of nesting allowed is configurable.

== Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity

| Enabled

| 0.25
| 0.81
|===

This cop checks that the cyclomatic complexity of methods is not higher
than the configured maximum. The cyclomatic complexity is the number of
linearly independent paths through a method. The algorithm counts
decision points and adds one.

An if statement (or unless or ?:) increases the complexity by one. An
else branch does not, since it doesn't add a decision point. The &&
operator (or keyword and) can be converted to a nested if statement,
and ||/or is shorthand for a sequence of ifs, so they also add one.
Loops can be said to have an exit condition, so they add one.

|===

This cop tries to produce a complexity score that's a measure of the
complexity the reader experiences when looking at a method. For that
reason it considers `when` nodes as something that doesn't add as much
complexity as an `if` or a `&&`. Except if it's one of those special
`case`/`when` constructs where there's no expression after `case`. Then
the cop treats it as an `if`/`elsif`/`elsif`... and lets all the `when`
nodes count. In contrast to the CyclomaticComplexity cop, this cop
considers `else` nodes as adding complexity.
