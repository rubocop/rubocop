|===

This cop checks for the use of JSON class methods which have potential
security issues.

Autocorrect is disabled by default because it's potentially dangerous.
If using a stream, like `JSON.load(open('file'))`, it will need to call
`#read` manually, like `JSON.parse(open('file').read)`.
If reading single values (rather than proper JSON objects), like
`JSON.load('false')`, it will need to pass the `quirks_mode: true`
option, like `JSON.parse('false', quirks_mode: true)`.
Other similar issues may apply.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
JSON.load("{}")
JSON.restore("{}")

# good
JSON.parse("{}")
----

This cop checks for the use of Marshal class methods which have
potential security issues leading to remote code execution when
loading from an untrusted source.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
Marshal.load("{}")
Marshal.restore("{}")

# good
Marshal.dump("{}")

# okish - deep copy hack
Marshal.load(Marshal.dump({}))

This cop checks for the use of `Kernel#open`.

`Kernel#open` enables not only file access but also process invocation
by prefixing a pipe symbol (e.g., `open("| ls")`). So, it may lead to
a serious security risk by using variable input to the argument of
`Kernel#open`. It would be better to use `File.open`, `IO.popen` or
`URI#open` explicitly.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
open(something)

# good
File.open(something)
IO.popen(something)
URI.parse(something).open

This cop checks for the use of YAML class methods which have
potential security issues leading to remote code execution when
loading from an untrusted source.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
YAML.load("--- foo")

# good
YAML.safe_load("--- foo")
YAML.dump("foo")
