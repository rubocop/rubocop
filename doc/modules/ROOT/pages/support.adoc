RuboCop currently has several official & unofficial support channels.

For questions, suggestions, and support refer to one of them. Please, don't
use the support channels to report issues, as this makes them harder to track.

== Gitter

Most internal discussions about the development of RuboCop happen on its
https://gitter.im/bbatsov/rubocop[gitter channel]. You can often find
RuboCop's maintainers there and get some interesting news from the project's
kitchen.

== Mailing List

The https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubocop[official mailing list] is
hosted at Google Groups. It's a low-traffic list, so don't be too hesitant to subscribe.

== Freenode

If you're into IRC you can visit the `#rubocop` channel on Freenode.
It's not actively
monitored by the RuboCop maintainers themselves, but still you can get support
from other RuboCop users there.

== Stackoverflow

We're also encouraging users to ask RuboCop-related questions on StackOverflow.

When doing so you should use the
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rubocop[RuboCop] tag (ideally combined
with the tag `ruby`).

== Bountysource

If you're willing to pay for some feature to be implemented you can use
https://www.bountysource.com/teams/rubocop/issues[Bountysource] to place a
bounty for the work you want to be done.
