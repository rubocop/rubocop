= Installation

RuboCop's installation is pretty standard:

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install rubocop
----

If you'd rather install RuboCop using `bundler`, don't require it in your `Gemfile`:

[source,rb]
----
gem 'rubocop', require: false
----

RuboCop's development is moving at a very rapid pace and there are
often backward-incompatible changes between minor releases (since we
haven't reached version 1.0 yet). To prevent an unwanted RuboCop update you
might want to use a conservative version locking in your `Gemfile`:

[source,rb]
----
gem 'rubocop', '~> 0.84.0', require: false
----

NOTE: You can check out our progress on the road to version 1.0 https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/milestone/4[here].
You can also help us get there faster! :-)
