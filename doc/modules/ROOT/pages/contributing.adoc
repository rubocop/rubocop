== Issues

Report issues and suggest features and improvements on the
https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/issues[GitHub issue tracker]. Don't ask
questions on the issue tracker - use the xref:support.adoc[support channels] instead.

If you want to file a bug, please provide all the necessary info listed in
our issue reporting template (it's loaded automatically when you create a
new GitHub issue).

== Patches

Patches in any form are always welcome! GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)

Before submitting a patch or a pull request make sure all tests are
passing and that your patch is in line with the https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contribution
guidelines].

A handy way to test only the files that you have modified in the last commit
(with `rspec` and `rubocop`) is to use `rake check_commit`.

Also see the xref:development.adoc[Development section].

== Documentation

Good documentation is just as important as good code.
Please, help us improve RuboCop's documentation.

You should also check out the
xref:development.adoc#documentation[cop documentation section] of the docs and consider
adding or improving Cop descriptions.

=== Working on the Docs

The manual is generated from the AsciiDoc files in the link:https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/tree/master/doc[doc] folder of RuboCop's GitHub repo and is published to https://docs.rubocop.org.
link:https://antora.org[Antora] is used to convert the manual into HTML.
The filesystem layout is described at https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/component-structure/.

To make changes to the manual you simply have to change the files under `doc`.
The manual will be regenerated manually periodically.

==== Installing Antora

NOTE: The instructions here assume you already have (the right version of) node.js installed.

Installing the Antora is super simple:

[source]
----
$ npm i -g @antora/cli@2.0 @antora/site-generator-default@2.0
----

Check out https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/install/install-antora/[the detailed installation instructions]
if you run into any problems.

==== Building the Site

You can build the documentation locally from the link:https://github.com/rubocop-hq/docs.rubocop.org[docs.rubocop.org] repo.

[source]
----
$ cd docs.rubocop.org
$ antora --pull antora-playbook.yml
----

After you're done with the initial setup you can use the `deploy` script to push changes to the site:

[source]
----
./deploy
----

NOTE: You'll need commit access to the repository for this to work.

To check the generated site you can simply open `docs/index.html` in your favourite browser.

If you want to make changes to the manual's page structure you'll have to edit
link:https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/doc/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[nav.adoc].

== Funding

While RuboCop is free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of a couple of thousand dollars would make it possible to pay people to work on
certain complex features, fund other development related stuff (e.g. hardware, conference trips) and so on.
Raising a monthly budget of over $5000 would open the possibility of someone working full-time on the project
which would speed up the pace of development significantly.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a wide array of funding channels to account
for your preferences (although currently https://opencollective.com/rubocop[Open Collective] is our preferred funding platform).

If you're working in a company that's making significant use of RuboCop we'd appreciate it if you suggest to your company
to become a RuboCop sponsor.
